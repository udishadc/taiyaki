    """Finds the best alignment between a matrix of flipflop transition scores
    and a sequence.

    Returns the score calculated for the best path, and an array of
    sequence positions that correspond to that path. The positions array
    has length 1 more than the scores matrix; this is because the scores
    matrix contains scores for transitions that will either move us to the
    next position, or stay at the same position.

    The entire sequence must be used in the alignment, but the scores might
    be clipped, depending on the value of localpen. This is acheived by
    introducing "start" and "end" states. The alignment must start in the
    "start" state, move out of "start" into the first position in the
    sequence, traverse the entire sequence, and then enter the "end" state.
    The alignment can stay in the "start" or "end" states by paying a cost
    of localpen while ignoring the next row of transition scores.
    Therefore, a large value of localpen will force the entire scores
    matrix to be used in the alignment ("global mapping"), while smaller
    values will lead to more clipping ("glocal mapping"). The time spent in
    the "start" and "end" states will be marked with -1s.


    The output positions array will have 3 sections:
      1. zero or more -1s for time spent in the "start" state
      2. a monotonic sequence of positions starting with 0 and ending with
         len(sequence) - 1
      3. zero or more -1s for time spend in the "end" state
